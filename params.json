Serialize the callable with it's globals using [dill](https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill)\r\n\r\n2. Upload the .lambda.dump file containing the serialized function along with the rest of the package\r\n\r\n3. Special ```container.py``` module will look for the .lambda.dump file and inject deserialized function into it's namespace\r\n\r\n4. ????\r\n\r\n5. Profit\r\n\r\nP.S. Lambdify is a POC, and at the time allows your lambda to only use site-packages, all local files won't be packaged, so each user-defined dependency should be contained withing the same file.",
